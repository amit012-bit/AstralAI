   - Privacy standards (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
   - Industry certifications (FDA, CE Mark, etc.)
   - Look in "Security", "Compliance", "Certifications", "Privacy" sections

2. Extract compliance certifications as an array of strings:
   - Standard names (e.g., "SOC 2 Type II", "HIPAA Compliant", "GDPR Compliant", "ISO 27001")
   - Include version numbers or types when mentioned (e.g., "SOC 2 Type II", "HIPAA BAA")
3. If certifications are mentioned that don't fit standard names, include them in complianceCertificationsOther as a comma-separated string

   - **Privacy**: GDPR, CCPA, PIPEDA, Privacy Shield (deprecated)
   - **Industry**: PCI DSS (for payments), WCAG (accessibility)
5. Look for certification mentions in:
   - "Security" or "Compliance" pages
   - Footer trust badges
   - "Trust & Safety" sections
   - Press releases or announcements
   - Customer-facing documentation

}
