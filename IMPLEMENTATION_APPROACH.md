# Implementation Approach - Complete Add Solution Page Rewrite

Given the scope, I'll implement this in phases:

## Phase 1: Backend Vendor Parsing API ✅ (Ready to implement)
- Create vendor parser controller
- Create prompt files
- Add route
- Test API

## Phase 2: Frontend Complete Rewrite (Main task)
Since you want the complete file from scratch, I'll create:
- Complete new `/solutions/new.tsx` with tabbed interface
- All section components
- All hooks
- Full integration

This will be a comprehensive file. Given the size, I should:
1. Create the main structure first
2. Then build out each section
3. Wire everything together

Should I proceed with creating the complete implementation now? This will be a large file (~1000+ lines), but it will have everything integrated.

## Alternative: Modular Approach
Alternatively, I could create:
- Main page file
- Separate component files for each section
- Cleaner, more maintainable

Which approach do you prefer?
1. **Single large file** (everything in one file)
2. **Modular** (main file + separate components)

I recommend modular for maintainability, but I can do either.
